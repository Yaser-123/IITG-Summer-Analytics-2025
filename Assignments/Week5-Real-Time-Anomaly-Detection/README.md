## ⚙️ How to Run

> **Prerequisite**: Python 3.8+ recommended.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Assignment-5.git
   cd Assignment-5

2. **Open a Notebook**

   * Launch Jupyter Lab or VS Code
   * Navigate to the folder you want (e.g., `Module-1/`)
   * Open and run the `.ipynb` file

3. **Install Dependencies**
   *(If not already installed — no `requirements.txt` needed if you install manually)*

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn torch torchvision
   ```
