> **Dive into Machine Learning with hands-on, interactive modules made for learning by doing — and having fun while you're at it!**

This isn’t just another ML assignment — it’s your **playground**. Whether you're classifying spam or predicting house prices, each module is built to **help you see Machine Learning in action**.

## 📦 What's Inside? Your ML Adventure Map!

Each module is a self-contained mini-project — explore, run, and tweak things to truly understand how each ML concept works.

| 🧩 Module        | 🔍 Concept                  | 🎯 What You'll Do                                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **KNN**          | K-Nearest Neighbors         | Classify points based on neighbors. Visualize how distance decides class! |
| **Spam**         | Text Classification         | Build a basic spam filter with real-world email data.        |
| **K-Fold**       | Cross-Validation            | Evaluate models more robustly using K-Fold strategy.         |
| **Random Forest**| Ensemble Learning           | Learn how forests (of decision trees 🌲) boost accuracy.     |
| **House Prediction** | Regression              | Predict house prices using regression on real data.          |

## 🛠️ How to Run the Modules (It’s Easy!)

Follow these simple steps to dive in:

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Assignment-3.git
   cd Assignment-3

2. **Pick a module**
   Go into any folder like `Module-1/` or `Module-2/`, based on what you want to explore.

3. **Launch the notebook**

   * Using **Jupyter Notebook**:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

     Then open the `.ipynb` file inside the module folder.
   * Or open it in **VS Code** (with the Jupyter extension).

4. **Start exploring!**
   Run the cells, change values, test assumptions — this is your sandbox. 🧪
